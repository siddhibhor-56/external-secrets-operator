# External Secrets Operator for Red Hat OpenShift

This repository contains the External Secrets Operator for Red Hat OpenShift. The operator runs in the `external-secrets-operator` namespace and deploys and manages the upstream [external-secrets](https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets) application on OpenShift clusters using static YAML manifests embedded as bindata.

The External Secrets Operator operates as a cluster-wide service that integrates external secrets management systems -- such as AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, Google Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, IBM Cloud Secrets Manager, and AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store -- with the OpenShift Container Platform, performing secret fetching, refreshing, and provisioning within the cluster.

Using the External Secrets Operator ensures the following:
- Decouples applications from the secret-lifecycle management.
- Centralizes secret storage to support compliance requirements.
- Enables secure and automated secret rotation.
- Supports multi-cloud secret sourcing with fine-grained access control.
- Centralizes and audits access control.

## Architecture

The operator uses two singleton custom resources (both named `cluster`) for configuration:

| Custom Resource | Purpose |
|-----------------|---------|
| `ExternalSecretsConfig` (`esc`) | Operand installation and configuration |
| `ExternalSecretsManager` (`esm`) | Status aggregation and global settings |

Three controllers handle the operator lifecycle:

| Controller | Responsibility |
|------------|----------------|
| `external_secrets` | Installs and manages the external-secrets application based on user-defined configuration in the `ExternalSecretsConfig` CR. |
| `external_secrets_manager` | Reconciles the `ExternalSecretsManager` CR, provides aggregated status from other controllers, and auto-creates the default `cluster` CR. |
| `crd_annotator` | Adds `cert-manager.io/inject-ca-from` annotations to external-secrets CRDs. Activates only when [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) is installed. |

The operand manifests are pre-rendered from upstream Helm charts at build time (`hack/update-external-secrets-manifests.sh`) and embedded via `openshift/build-machinery-go` into `pkg/operator/assets/bindata.go`.

## Tech Stack

| cert-manager | v1.18.5 |
| External Secrets (operand) | v2.5.0 |
| Container tool | podman (default; override with `CONTAINER_TOOL=docker`) |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.26+
- podman (or docker) 17.03+
- kubectl v1.32.1+ / oc
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.32.1+ / OpenShift cluster

### Building

```sh
make build              # Full build: manifests, generate, fmt, vet, then compile
make build-operator     # Compile the operator binary only (no codegen or checks)
make image-build        # Build the container image with podman
```

To build and push a custom image:

```sh
make image-build image-push IMG=<registry>/external-secrets-operator:<tag>
```

### Deploying to a Cluster

Install CRDs and deploy the operator:

```sh
make install                                            # Install CRDs
make deploy IMG=<registry>/external-secrets-operator:<tag>  # Deploy the operator
kubectl apply -k config/samples/                        # Create sample CRs
```

To uninstall:

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
make uninstall
make undeploy
```

### Generating a Standalone Installer

```sh
make build-installer IMG=<registry>/external-secrets-operator:<tag>
# Produces dist/install.yaml containing all resources
kubectl apply -f dist/install.yaml
```

## Testing

| Make Target | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `make test` | Run all non-e2e tests (`test-apis` + `test-unit`); no cluster required. |
| `make test-unit` | Run unit tests (excludes `test/e2e`, `test/apis`, `test/utils`). |
| `make test-apis` | Run API integration tests (Ginkgo + envtest). |
| `make test-e2e` | Run end-to-end tests against a live cluster. |

E2E tests support label filtering for provider-specific or scenario-specific runs:

```sh
make test-e2e E2E_GINKGO_LABEL_FILTER="Provider:Vault"
```

For full E2E details including prerequisites, suite-specific commands, and cross-platform labels, see [test/e2e/README.md](test/e2e/README.md).

Detailed testing conventions (unit test style, table-driven patterns, envtest setup) are documented in [harness-evals/harness-docs/testing-guidelines.md](harness-evals/harness-docs/testing-guidelines.md).

## Verification and Linting

Before submitting a PR, run the CI gate check:

```sh
make verify          # Runs vet, fmt, deps, bindata, generated files, govulncheck, markdownlint, and git diff
make lint            # Run golangci-lint
make lint-fix        # Run golangci-lint with auto-fix
make lint-markdown   # Run markdownlint-cli2 on docs (also invoked by make verify)
```

`make verify` is the single gate that CI enforces. It catches generated-file drift, dependency inconsistencies, formatting issues, markdown style problems, and vulnerability scan failures.

## Code Generation

Several files in this repository are generated and must not be hand-edited:

| File | Regenerate With |
|------|-----------------|
| `pkg/operator/assets/bindata.go` | `make update-bindata` |
| `pkg/controller/client/fakes/fake_ctrl_client.go` | `go generate ./pkg/controller/client/...` |
| `**/zz_generated.deepcopy.go` | `make generate` |
| CRD YAML in `config/crd/bases/` | `make manifests` |

To regenerate everything at once:

```sh
make update    # generate + manifests + update-operand-manifests + update-bindata + bundle + docs
```
