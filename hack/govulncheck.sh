# Script to run govulncheck and filter known vulnerabilities.
# Usage: ./hack/govulncheck.sh <govulncheck_binary> <output_dir>
#
# Arguments:
#   govulncheck_binary: Path to the govulncheck binary
#   output_dir: Directory to store results
#
# Environment variables:
#   ARTIFACT_DIR: If set and directory exists, results are copied there for CI artifact collection

# Known vulnerabilities to ignore (in vendored packages, not operator code).
# Each vulnerability ID has been reviewed and deemed acceptable.
#
# KNOWN_VULNS_UNTIL (UTC, YYYY-MM-DD): ignores are valid through this date inclusive.
# After it expires, re-run the scan, drop fixed IDs, re-justify remaining ones, and
# advance this date (typically ~2 weeks).

## Below vulnerabilities are in the kubernetes package, which impacts the server and not the operator, which is the client.
# - https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-3521 - Kubernetes GitRepo Volume Inadvertent Local Repository Access in k8s.io/kubernetes --
# - https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-3547 - Kubernetes kube-apiserver Vulnerable to Race Condition in k8s.io/kubernetes --
#
## Below vulnerabilities are in the go packages, which doesn't impact the operator code and requires the fix to be available downstream.
# - https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2026-4918 - HTTP/2 infinite loop via SETTINGS_MAX_FRAME_SIZE of 0 in net/http, golang.org/x/net --
# - https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2026-5026 - x/net/idna: ToUnicode accepts Punycode labels encoding pure ASCII labels --
# - https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2026-5970 - x/text/unicode/norm: infinite loop on invalid UTF-8 input. --
# - https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2026-5972 - Enforce maximum recursion depth in encoding/asn1
